# "Evoke" CM4 Carrier Board

This is a breakout board for a CM4, maybe suitable for a DIY tablet. The original intent was a modular product, but it never happened due to component shortages. Maybe someone will find it useful.

Todo: Switch the PCIe slot to a better use of the lanes, like USB 3. TUSB7320 or UPD720202K8 is readibly available now.
